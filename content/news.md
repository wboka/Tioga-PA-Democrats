Fellow Pennsylvania Voter: 

Election Day is not far away - NOW is the time to register to vote or check your registration status and apply for a mail-in or absentee ballot!
Don’t wait – start today! Go online today to votespa.com to learn more about voting in Pennsylvania, to register to vote, and to apply for a mail-in ballot. Once you receive your ballot, you may drop it off in person at your county election offices, or send by mail, but make sure to apply soon!  The deadline to register to vote is **Oct. 19**, and the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot is **Oct. 27**, but with expected postal delays you should apply as soon as possible.
If you apply to vote by mail and provide your email, you will get notifications along the way. You can check the status of your ballot at any time HERE. A status of ‘pending’ means your application has already been received or you are signed up to be an annual mail-in ballot voter, and either way your ballot will automatically be mailed to you when it is ready. If you have already applied, there is no need to apply again.
Stay safe and well, and happy voting!

Kathy Boockvar , Secretary of the Commonwealth

Tioga county is sending its first mail ballots out over the coming days, and most folks signed up to vote by mail should receive their ballot within 1-2 weeks.
As soon as your ballot arrives, follow these four steps to be absolutely sure your voice is heard in this crucial election:
     
1) Complete your entire ballot in blue or black ink as soon as you receive it.
2) Seal your ballot inside the smaller secrecy envelope; then, place that in the larger return envelope. If you do not place the ballot in the secrecy envelope first, it will not count!
3) Sign and complete the Voter Declaration on the back of the larger return envelope.
4) Mail your ballot, or return it in person to an official dropoff location in your county. Check iwillvote.com/pa to find out where you can drop off your ballot.

**REMEMBER**: Your ballot will NOT be counted if you don’t use the secrecy envelope or complete and sign the voter declaration!  All Pennsylvanians voting early or by mail must seal their ballot in **TWO** envelopes: _the smaller, white secrecy envelope and then the larger return envelope!_
